# SpectrogramDress
### Inspiration
![Dress](dress.jpg)

The idea for this project came when I was looking at some spectrograms for sound and realized that the pattern looked a lot like the pattern of a dress I did a couple of years ago. I wanted to create a framework for a site where you could make a dress with a message from a loved one, an inspiring quote or a part of your favorite song.
